        }
    }
}
```

            "carry"          "500"
            "tracer_type"    "none"
        }
    }

            {
                ...
            }
            "allowed_items"
            {
                "weapon"    "weapon_flamethrower_british"
                "weapon"    "weapon_flamethrower_american"
                "weapon"    "weapon_flamethrower_german"
                ...
            }
        }
    }
}
```
### 5. Install plugin
Remove other versions of flamethrower plugin
<br>Put FlameThrower_public.smx and WeaponAttachmentAPI.smx into "insurgency\addons\sourcemod\plugins\"
### 6. Particles file
Put custom\Flamethrower_Particles_dir.vpk and custom\Flamethrower_Particles_000.vpk to your fastdl folder, and make sure player is forced to download these two vpk files to them custom folder when they join your server.

If you don't have a fastdl server, player also need to subscribe the required mod by themself, otherwise the flamethrower fire particles effect won't show up if player didn't reconnect to your server when they first join your server erverytime after they start the game program.
